            collapse under their own gravity to reach enormous or even infinite densities.</p>

            <li>1929-1939: the theory of white dwarfs</li>

            <li>1943-1950: the theory of radiative transfer</li>
            <li>1952-1961: hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability</li>
            <li>1961-1968: the equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium</li>
            <li>1962-1971: the general theory of relativity and relativistic astrophysics</li>
            <li>1974- 1983: the mathematical theory of black holes</li>

            <li>In the end, scientists came to accept that Chandrasekhar was correct, and Eddington was wrong. It
                was a slow process, taking about 30 years.</li>

            <li>It is now accepted that the ultimate fate of stars depends on their masses. Smaller stars become
                white dwarfs, while larger stars, after a supernova, can become neutron stars or black holes.</li>

            <li>In 1983, Chandrasekhar was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics “for his theoretical studies of the
                physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars.” He shared the prize
                with William Fowler.</li>
